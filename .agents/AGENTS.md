# Project Memory & Rules: Tech & Ouro

## Tiago's Launch & Roadmap Goals
* **Developer/Creator:** Tiago Miguel Saianda dos Santos. Works 150%, values high-quality, clean code. Owns a fully remodeled house with a pool and sea view in the Algarve.
* **Site Branding & Merchandise:** The golden lion logo (`logo-lion.jpg`) is a core brand asset intended for future merchandise (shirts, caps, cups). Design elements should respect this premium identity.
* **Phase 1 (Current):** Launch active for Portugal 🇵🇹, Brasil 🇧🇷, and UK 🇬🇧. Custom budget on Google Ads (€5-€10/day) to keep things affordable.
* **Phase 2 (6 to 9 Months):** Expand/uncomment Canada 🇨🇦, USA 🇺🇸, Ireland 🇮🇪, and Switzerland 🇨🇭 on the countries page, and raise the ad budget.
* **Phase 3 (2 Years):** Expand to Australia 🇦🇺 and New Zealand 🇳🇿.

## Coding Rules & Preferences
* **Bilingual Site:** The site is fully bilingual (PT/EN). All text tags should support `lang="pt"` and `lang="en"`.
* **Global Selector:** Navbars must include the `[ PT | EN ]` toggle and link to `script.js` at the bottom of the body.
* **Terminal Widget:** Keep the interactive `#term` widget in `terminal.html` intact (cleanly wrapped in the site template).
* **AI News Aggregator:** Automated via `scripts/update_news.py` and GitHub Actions using free RSS feeds.

## Interaction & Output Rules (Web Chat Synchronization)
* **Style:** Direct to the point, no fluff, no introductory or concluding sentences.
* **Language:** Bilingual (Portuguese/English).
* **Focus:** Target files in the `scripts` and `conteudos` folders.

## Current Status
* **Safari Issue:** Safari Reader mode triggered automatically on `mercados.html` and `tech.html`. Fixed by replacing semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`) with `<div>`.
* **News Design:** Changed the image pipeline to use a CSS-only "Gold Mosaic" premium banner instead of relying on external image APIs. The site looks very premium.
* **Countries Page (`paises.html`):** Cleaned up layout, removed dummy cards, added a unified `<!-- AI_NEWS_START -->` block at the bottom for global news, keeping tabs clean for macro stats.
* **AI Provider:** The previous Google AI provider has been removed at Tiago's request. Do not restore or call it unless Tiago explicitly chooses a fresh provider setup.
* **Next Assistant Instructions:** When Tiago opens a new conversation, acknowledge that you read this status and are ready to continue Phase 1 work at 150%. No need to repeat the history, just say you are the "Novo Diretor de Arte".

## Operational Agents
The project now runs with these working agents. Any future assistant should use them as roles when maintaining the site.

### 1. Diretor de Arte & Produto
* Owns visual quality, premium gold/black identity, bilingual layout, mobile polish, and Safari/Chrome checks.
* Must preserve the lion brand assets and avoid cheap-looking templates.

### 2. Agente de Noticias AI
* Owns `scripts/update_news.py`, `conteudos/`, GitHub Actions, RSS/manual sources, and the 60% index rotation rule.
* Must keep summaries tight, factual, and bilingual. Never invent facts, dates, sources, prices, quotes, or URLs.
* Desktop news queue lives at `/Users/tmss1988/Desktop/tech e ouro`. Use `python3 scripts/news_queue_agent.py` to stage files from bottom to top (oldest first when Finder shows newest first).
* Queue files are moved into `conteudos/fila-*`, used by `scripts/update_news.py`, then cleaned after successful publish via `conteudos/news-queue-manifest.json`. Do not commit queue files or queue manifests.
* Daily news older than 30 hours is stale and must be moved to `/Users/tmss1988/Desktop/tech e ouro/_descartadas` instead of being published. Monthly/weekly magazine sources can stay eligible for up to 45 days but must not outrank fresh daily news.
* Ignore ad/support files such as `add*.jpg`, AdSense/Goggle files, `.DS_Store`, and video helper files.

### 3. Agente de Publicidade & Contas
* Owns Google Ads, Google AdSense, Netlify billing, GitHub usage, domain/DNS renewal, and monthly invoice review.
* Must verify `ads.txt`, AdSense publisher ID, Google Ads tag, campaign spend, invoices, payment status, and budget limits.
* Must never increase ad budgets, add payment methods, or expose private invoice/account data without Tiago's explicit confirmation at that moment.

### 4. Agente de Fiabilidade
* Owns uptime checks, broken routes, redirects, missing assets, deployment status, and health reports.
* Must run `python3 scripts/ops_health_report.py` and `python3 scripts/health_check.py` before and after meaningful deploys.

### 5. Agente de Crescimento Global
* Owns the long-term 650M-person ambition: Portuguese and English markets first, then carefully scaled countries.
* Must keep expansion tied to real budget control, quality content, and measurable ads performance.
