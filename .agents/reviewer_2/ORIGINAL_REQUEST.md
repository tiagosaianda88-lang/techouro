Review the news pipeline implementation:
1. Examine scripts/update_news.py, scripts/test_update_news.py, scripts/verify_translations.py, and conteudos/manual-news.json for correctness, completeness, robustness, and interface conformance.
2. Verify that Expresso, Diário de Notícias, Google Wall Street, MarketWatch, and Barron's search feeds are correctly configured in RSS_FEEDS.
3. Verify that the url field is correctly propagated through CollectorAgent, EditorAgent, and VerifierAgent.
4. Verify that PublisherAgent correctly renders the source name as a hyperlink inside the card's metadata in index.html and noticias.html.
5. Run scripts/test_update_news.py and scripts/verify_translations.py to verify they pass successfully.
Write your findings and test output in handoff.md under /Users/tmss1988/Desktop/netfily/.agents/reviewer_2 and report when complete.
